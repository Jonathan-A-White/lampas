// src/nav/lastRoute.ts — Lampas reopens where he left it, even after the app was closed (mw-5r3p30.20), as
// Postern does (its src/nav/lastRoute.ts). The address he is at (the hash, src/nav/route.ts: the screen, and in
// the reader the chapter, view, weave and selected verse) is kept on every move, and a bare open (the home-screen
// icon, start_url '/') goes back to it. An open that names a place (a shared link) wins over it. Kept in
// localStorage, not Dexie: the router reads the address synchronously before the first render.
//
// The last 20 addresses he visited (the trail) are kept, and a cold open rebuilds the browser's own history from
// them, so Back walks them as if he never closed the app (and, past the oldest, lands on Home). Every history
// entry carries its place in the trail (history.state.i); the trail is kept up to the entry he is on. Each address
// also keeps its own scroll offsets (src/nav/scrollMemory.ts).
